How to use the Power List:

Everyday, write in 5 critical tasks to complete for that day. If you complete the task, put a "" in the box next to the task. If you do not complete the task by the end of the day, put a "x" in the box next to that task.

If you complete all 5 tasks that day, you win the day.

Circle the "W" at the bottom of the page.

If you do not complete all 5 tasks, you failed to win the day.

Circle the "L" at the bottom of the page.

Once a task has been on your power list for 21 days straight and been completed all 21 days in a row, it is considered a habit that you will complete automatically. You must now remove that task from the list and replace it with a new critical task.

The goal is to win every single day.

When you create a habit of winning, it creates momentum and confidence.

When you win enough weeks, you win the month.

When you win enough months, you win the year.

When you win enough years, YOU WIN YOUR LIFE.

All the screens and elements are sleek, minimal, and easy to understand, adhering to the concept of a straightforward, user-friendly experience.

Please ensure that the UI designer and developer who will be working on this project are familiar with these elements and concepts. They may need to adjust and add more details to this basic concept to ensure that the application meets all of your needs and is as user-friendly as possible.

I'd recommend using a software like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to create high-fidelity wireframes or prototypes based on these concepts before the actual development begins. This will ensure everyone is on the same page and any potential issues can be ironed out in advance.
